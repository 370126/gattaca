# About us

The Gattaca Laboratory was founded in 2003 by Prof. Dacheng Tian and Prof. Jianqun Chen, growing out of the work of NJU's Molecule Biology and Ecology Group, and building on the seminal work of faculty members in a range of other disciplines, from bioinformatics and computer science.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

A fundamental problem in evolutionary biology is how genetic variation is created and maintained. Our research focuses on this problem, although we are also interested in other issues of evolutionary genomics. Our experiments are mainly divided into two parts, molecular group and information group. The former is mainly engaged in molecular biology experiments, and the latter mainly uses computer programs to analyze sequences. In actual operation, molecules and information often penetrate and learn from each other.
